# gift-code-generator

A simple program which generates random gift codes for different platforms
the gift codes aren't automatically checked to see if they are working, only the nitro gen one does.

1. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. run `python main.py`

DISCLAIMER:
I don't take responsibility for any outcomes of your use of this.
I created this as a proof of concept.
I will not and do not take responsibility for your actions.
The odds of these codes working are actually very slim, however if one does work and you get into legal trouble, i do not take responsibility.
